== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I control which image is displayed on hover? =

Whichever image is first in the order of product gallery images will appear on hover.

= My secondary image is taller than the main product image and overlaps content when it fades in =

This is due to the secondary image being positioned absolutely. This is the cleanest way I can think to do this with CSS alone. You may want to consider hard cropping your product catalog thumbnails to ensure all images are the same dimensions in product archives.

= It doesn't work. Nothing happens when I hover over images? =

First of all check that the product you're checking has a gallery attached to it. Secondly you should be aware that this plugin uses CSS 3d transforms and will therefore only work in modern browsers.

Note: This plugin uses CSS 3d transforms to show/hide the images and will therefore only work in modern browsers.
